## Lane and Stopline Detection for Urban Roads <br>
The repository contains code for detecting lanes and stoplines on urban roads. It uses image processing based techniques to extract lane features, suppress noise and fit a parabolic lane model to detect urban lane markings. For stopline detection, clustering and principal component analysis based techinques are used to identify horizontal markings on roads. The code has been tested on the KITTI dataset, and has been deployed on the Mahindra E20 autonomous vehicle. <br>
